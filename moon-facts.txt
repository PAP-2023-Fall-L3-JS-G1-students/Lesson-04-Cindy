The Moon is drifting away from the Earth. It is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet every year.

Although it appears bright in the night sky, the Moonâ€™s surface is actually dark, with a reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt.

The Moon always shows Earth the same face, it is in synchronous rotation with Earth.

The Moon is the second densest satellite, among those whose densities are known. The first densest is Jupiter's satellite Io. 

There is water on the Moon! It has been detected on areas of the lunar surface that are in permanent shadow and was likely delivered to the surface by comets.

The Moon has quakes called moonquakes. They are caused by the gravitational influence of the Earth and can last up to half an hour.
